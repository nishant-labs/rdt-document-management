# rdt-document-management

## Assumptions (application is scalable enough to extend for any specific requirements)
- By default api will get data for all countries in 2 separate calls
- Only implemented default sorting and filtering
- Only displaying country name, population and GDP
- Displaying first 50 records only

## Decisions taken
- Instead of page loader used text based message
- For simplicity only handled error scenarios where api failed for any reason and only showing message instead of dedicated error page
